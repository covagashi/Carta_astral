      "text": "The 1st house, referred to as the Ascendant: the Self, demeanour, and vitality. It describes the personality, the natural demeanour of the native as he faces the outside world, and also his physical appearance. It is an essential component for the interpretation of the natal chart, and it is one of the four angles of the natal chart (the four most important houses, which are dealt with below). It is located on the left hand side of the natal chart and corresponds to the place where the sun rises. The first astrological house is in analogy to the first sign of the zodiac, Aries.
The position of the celestial bodies, as seen from the Earth and the place of birth, is established in connection with a system of coordinates based on the horizon and the zenith. For each astrological chart, the time and place of birth are processed in order to get markers that are specific to the individual. This is how it becomes possible to materialize the positions of the planets, the Sun, and the Moon in the window of heaven known as the Zodiac. The celestial belt where the Sun relentlessly follows his course, when seen from the Earth, is divided into twelve equal parts called zodiacal signs. It all works out as if all the human features were represented within the whole twelve signs. Each sign reflects an independent and strong typology, complementary to the other signs, expressing by itself its nature and its personality with its characteristics, its tendencies and its motivations."
